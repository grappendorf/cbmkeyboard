CBM Keyboard Adapter
====================

![alt tag](https://github.com/grappendorf/cbmkeyboard/raw/master/cbmkeyboard-adapter.jpg)

This ATmega168 based controller connects the matrix keyboard of an old Commodore CBM
PC to a PS2 port.

It was used im my [Retro CBM PC project](http://www.grappendorf.net/projects/retro-cbm-pc.html).
